Feature Architecture

Overview
--------

A brief overview of Lifecycle is described :need:`doc__lifecycle`.

Description
-----------

The concept is based on 2 major components:

* **Launch Manager**: Responsible for starting and stopping components based on
  the defined Run States and alive supervision of the started components

* **Health Monitor**: Provides process local monitoring functionalities such as
  deadline monitoring and logical program flow monitoring

<Design Decisions - For the documentation of the decision the :need:`gd_temp__change_decision_record` can be used.>

<Design Constraints>


Rationale Behind Architecture Decomposition
*******************************************

Mandatory: A motivation for the decomposition

.. note:: Common decisions across features / cross cutting concepts is at the high level.

The Launch Manager configuration is structured around Run Target and Component configurations.
Each Component configuration specifies how the Component is started, monitored, and recovered during system operation. 
Components can have dependencies on other Components, collectively forming a dependency graph.

Run Targets are configured through Run Target configurations, which define dependencies on Components and other Run Targets.
These dependencies determine which Components are activated when a Run Target is activated.

The Launch Manager is configured with an *Initial Run Target* and *Fallback Run Target*. The *Initial Run Target* is activated when the Launch Manager is first started.
The *Fallback Run Target* specifies the Run Target that is activated if a failure occurs that cannot be recovered.


Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

Interactions between the :term:`Launch Manager` and a User application
(through it's interfaces):

* :doc:`./control_client`
* :doc:`./lifecycle_client`
* :doc:`./alive`
* :doc:`./launch_manager`
* :doc:`./external_monitoring`


Interaction between the :term:`Health Monitor` and :term:`Launch Manager`:

* :doc:`./health_monitor`


Logical Interfaces
------------------

The logical interfaces of the feature are defined in the `interfaces` section
of the feature documentation in the project repository:
:need:`doc__lifecycle_architecture`
